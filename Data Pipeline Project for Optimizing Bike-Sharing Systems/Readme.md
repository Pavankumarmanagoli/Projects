## 🗄️ Data Sources  

### 📡 NextBike API  
The primary data source is the NextBike API, which provides real-time information about bike-sharing systems across global cities.

**Data Collected:**  
- 📍 Station Information: Geographical coordinates, station status, total capacity, and available docks.  
- 🚲 Bike Availability: Real-time bike availability and status (on rent, available, or under maintenance).  
- 📊 Usage Data: Check-ins, check-outs, timestamps, and trip data.  
- 👥 User Demographics (if available): Anonymized data on age group, gender, and membership type.  

**⏰ Data Update Frequency:**  
The NextBike API updates data every minute, enabling accurate real-time analysis.

## ⚙️ Solution Architecture  

The solution is designed to handle large-scale real-time data through a robust and scalable architecture.

### 🏗️ Components:

**Data Ingestion:**  
- Python scripts fetch real-time data from the NextBike API.  
- Data is ingested into Google Cloud Storage for durability and scalability.  

**Data Processing:**  
- Google BigQuery processes raw data, performing necessary transformations and aggregations.  
- Data cleaning includes timestamp normalization, null value handling, and duplicate removal.  

**Data Visualization:**  
- Tableau connects directly to BigQuery to create real-time dashboards.  
- Visualizations include heatmaps, bike availability charts, and usage trends.  

---

## 🔄 Data Pipeline  

The data pipeline follows a structured ETL approach:

**Extract:**  
- Real-time data from NextBike API using Python scripts.

**Transform:**  
- Data preprocessing for format normalization, missing value imputation, and timestamp conversion.  
- Aggregation of key metrics like bike usage frequency and station availability.

**Load:**  
- Transformed data is loaded into Google BigQuery for querying and analysis.

## 💾 Data Processing & Storage  

### 🗃️ Google BigQuery:  
- Serverless, highly scalable data warehouse.  
- Handles large datasets efficiently with SQL-based querying.  
- Supports real-time analytics and historical data analysis.  

### ☁️ Google Cloud Storage (GCS):  
- Stores raw and processed data securely.  
- Ensures durability and availability for large-scale data.  

### Why Use Both GCS and BigQuery?

To build a robust, cost-effective ETL pipeline, we separate raw data landing from analytical storage:

| Component        | Role                                      | Benefits                                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GCS Staging**  | Landing zone for raw API JSON dumps       | - **Durability & Auditability**: Keep an immutable copy of every NextBike API response for reprocessing or audit.<br/>- **Decoupling**: Ingestion and processing are independent—failures downstream don’t block data collection.<br/>- **Cost Control**: Storing raw data in GCS is far cheaper than a data warehouse. |
| **BigQuery**     | Serverless data warehouse for analytics   | - **On-demand SQL**: Run ad-hoc or scheduled transforms at petabyte-scale without managing infrastructure.<br/>- **Schema Enforcement & Cleanup**: Deduplicate, normalize timestamps, and compute aggregates in a structured environment.<br/>- **BI & ML Ready**: Connect live to Tableau for auto-refreshing dashboards, and leverage built-in ML if you add forecasting or anomaly-detection. |

**Pipeline Flow**  
1. **Extract → GCS**  
   Python scripts poll the NextBike API every minute and write raw JSON files into a GCS “staging” bucket.  
2. **Query Raw → BigQuery External Tables**  
   BigQuery external tables point at your GCS JSON objects so you can query them in place with zero data duplication.  
3. **Transform & Load → BigQuery Processed Tables**  
   Scheduled SQL jobs in BigQuery clean, dedupe, normalize, and aggregate the data, then write results into partitioned “processed” tables optimized for querying.  
4. **Visualize → Tableau**  
   Tableau connects directly to the processed BigQuery tables via the GCP connector, delivering live, auto-refreshing dashboards.
