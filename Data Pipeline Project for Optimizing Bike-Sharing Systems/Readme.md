## 🗄️ Data Sources

### 📡 **NextBike API**  
The primary data source is the **NextBike API**, which provides **real-time information** about bike-sharing systems across global cities.

**Data Collected:**
- **📍 Station Information:** Geographical coordinates, station status, total capacity, and available docks.
- **🚲 Bike Availability:** Real-time bike availability and status (on rent, available, or under maintenance).
- **📊 Usage Data:** Check-ins, check-outs, timestamps, and trip data.
- **👥 User Demographics (if available):** Anonymized data on age group, gender, and membership type.

**⏰ Data Update Frequency:**  
- The NextBike API updates data **every minute**, enabling accurate real-time analysis.
