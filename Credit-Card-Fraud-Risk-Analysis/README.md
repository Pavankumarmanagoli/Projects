# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Risk Analysis â€“ Power BI Project

Fraud detection is a growing challenge for banks and financial institutions as transaction volumes continue to rise. In this project, we analyze credit card transaction data to detect and assess fraud risk using Power BI. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of fraud types, risk levels, and patterns across time, states, and merchant categories.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This Power BI project demonstrates how financial institutions can leverage business intelligence to monitor, detect, and respond to credit card fraud. The solution includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of an interactive dashboard to help analysts identify high-risk transactions and fraud hotspots.

Using various filters and visualizations, the dashboard offers deep insights into fraudulent behavior across multiple dimensions such as fraud type, transaction category, state, and time of year. It is designed to support both high-level monitoring and detailed drill-down analysis for operational teams.
