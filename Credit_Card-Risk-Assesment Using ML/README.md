# üí≥ Credit Card Risk Assessment ‚Äì Machine Learning Project

Credit card default poses a major risk to financial institutions. This project uses data science and machine learning to assess the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their credit card payments. The goal is to build a predictive model that supports data-driven credit risk evaluation and helps banks make informed lending decisions.

## üìä Project Overview

This notebook walks through the end-to-end process of credit risk assessment using structured customer data. By leveraging classification algorithms, we estimate the probability of default for each customer based on financial behavior, credit history, and demographic information.

The solution is designed to enhance risk profiling and help financial institutions make more accurate lending decisions.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding  
  - Feature scaling and transformation

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Visualized default distribution, credit limits, payment behaviors, and more  
  - Uncovered patterns linked to high-risk customers

- **Model Building & Evaluation**  
  - Trained multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
  - Evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC  
  - Performed hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization

- **Credit Risk Scoring**  
  - Assigned risk scores or probabilities to each customer  
  - Identified key factors contributing to default risk

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## üîç Insights

- Customers with consistently delayed payments and high credit utilization were more likely to default.  
- Key features influencing default risk included payment history, bill amounts, and previous payments.
