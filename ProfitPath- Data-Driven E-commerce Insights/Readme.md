# ðŸ“– ProfitPath: Data-Driven E-commerce Insights
ProfitPath explores how an online retailer can transform raw transaction data into meaningful,
businessâ€‘ready intelligence. The project demonstrates an endâ€‘toâ€‘end exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Overview
- **Objective:** uncover sales patterns and profitability drivers to support dataâ€‘informed decisions.
- **Notebook:** [`E_commerce_sales.ipynb`](E_commerce_sales.ipynb) contains the full analysis and visualisations.
- **Dataset:** [`Sample - Superstore.csv`](Sample%20-%20Superstore.csv) provides orderâ€‘level details such as order date, product category, sales and profit.

## Analysis Highlights
The notebook investigates:

1. **Monthly trends** â€“ peak and lowâ€‘performing periods for both sales and profit.
2. **Product category performance** â€“ top categories and subâ€‘categories versus underperformers.
3. **Customer segments** â€“ behaviour and contribution to revenue.
4. **Profitability timeline** â€“ how profit evolves across the year.
5. **Salesâ€‘toâ€‘profit ratio** â€“ effectiveness of converting sales into profit.

**Every data point has a storyâ€”this project is about bringing those stories to life.** ðŸš€
## Technology Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualisation
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and navigate to this project folder.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook E_commerce_sales.ipynb`.
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Results
The analysis pinpoints the months, categories and customer segments that drive profitability, while highlighting areas needing improvement. These insights help stakeholders optimise inventory, marketing and overall strategy.
